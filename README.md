# Block_Cipher

Programs to implement CBC mode of MDES (from Problem 1). Use this mode to encrypt the following text: 
cryptography is an important tool for network security. but there are other issues for network security. 

Solution Description:  
STEP 1: Input the original text. 
STEP 2: Pad “1” and “0” to the array list. 
STEP 3: Shuffle these array list having the block size 16. 
STEP 4: Performing decryption by creating a new array list and initializing the size and the length of this temporary array list. 
STEP 5: Performing encryption operation on the array list by appending “0” in the end of the string which is newly created.  
STEP 6: Finding the character location using “ At.Char function in order to know the location of both the array. 
STEP 7: The temporary character is converted into a string value. 
STEP 8: The cipher text is converted into binary value
